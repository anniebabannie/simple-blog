# Astro + Supabase branching

This is a starter application to accompany the blog post [Postgres branching with Astro + Supabase](link), which walks you through using Supabase branching in review applications on Fly.io. This app happens to use Astro, but the principles discussed in the blog post can be applied to any framework you like!

## Getting Started

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```
